# dual_style_flutter

One copy of Flutter app can be rendered on iOS and Android devices in Cupertino and Material style, respectively.

It would be a choice if you don't like the material style on iOS

## Example

Compare the transition animation on top navigation bar while you are going back to previous page

<img src="cupertino-style.GIF" width="300"/><img src="material-style.GIF" width="300"/>
